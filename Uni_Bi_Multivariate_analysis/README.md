The number of variables of interest featured by the data classifies it as univariate, bivariate, or multivariate

**Univariate Analysis**:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The key fact is that in univariate only one variable is involved.
Variables can be one of two types: categorical or numerical.

**Categorical Data**:

Categorical data classify items into groups. This type of data can be further broken down into nominal, ordinal, and binary values.
**Ordinal values** have a set order.
**Nominal values** have no set order.
**Binary data** has only two values. This could be represented as True/False or 1/0.

**Numerical Data**

Numerical data are values that we can perform mathematical operations on. 
They are further broken down into continuous and discrete data types.
**Discreet variables** have to be an integer. 
**Continuous variables**can be any value.

**Bivariate Analysis:**
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Bivariate analysis is the simultaneous analysis of two variables (attributes). 
It explores the concept of relationship between two variables.
whether there exists an association and the strength of this association, 
or whether there are differences between two variables and the significance of these differences.

**Multivariate Analysis:**

Multivariate analysis as analyzing more than two features.
Analysis differ as that variables are depends on each other or how much they will affect the prediction either they are highly correlated or not dependent on each other.

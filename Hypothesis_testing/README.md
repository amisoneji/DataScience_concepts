**Hypothesis test**

In hypothesis testing we evaluate two mutual exclusive statements on population using sample data.

Steps:
1) We have to make initial assumption (H0 â€“null hypothesis)
2) Collection data (Evidences)
3) Gathering evidence to reject or not reject null hypothesis H0 and alternate hypothesis H1.

**Confusion matrix**:
                            
                             |_________actual  value____________|
                             | True positive  | False positive  |
                             |       Ok       |  Type 1 error   |	
          Predictive value	  ______________________________
                             |  False negative| True negative   |
                             |  Type 2 error  |      Ok         |
    		                    

**Type 2 error (FALSE NEGATIVE):**
Any misclassification of positive sample will become False negative(because they are positive but classified as negative(FN).

**Type 1 error (FALSE POSITIVE):**
Any misclassification negative sample will become False Positive(because they are negative but classified as positive(FP).

**T test**
A t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features

T-test has 2 types : 
1. one sampled t-test 
2. 2. two-sampled t-test.

**Two-sample T-test With Python**
The Independent Samples t Test or 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different. The Independent Samples t Test is a parametric test. This test is also known as Independent t Test

**Paired T-test With Python**
When we want to check how different samples from the same group are, we can go for a paired T-test
